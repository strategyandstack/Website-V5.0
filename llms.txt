## Key Differentiators

1. **Ownership Model**: Unlike agencies, clients own everything built
2. **No Retainers**: One-time implementation, not ongoing fees
3. **Modular Design**: Systems can be stacked as needed
4. **Transparency**: Clear distinction between guaranteed deliverables and market-dependent outcomes
5. **Speed**: Implementation starts within 48 hours of agreement

## Common Questions

**Q: How is this different from an agency?**
A: Agencies charge monthly retainers and own the relationship with your tools. Strategy & Stack installs infrastructure you own outright with no lock-in.

**Q: What results can I expect?**
A: Guaranteed: work gets done correctly (emails sent, profiles optimized, campaigns launched). Market-dependent: response rates, conversion rates, meetings booked.

**Q: How long until results?**
A: Most clients see meaningful pipeline activity within 30-45 days of going live.
